** Day 45

Introduction to SpriteKit.

 - SKSpriteNode initialized from an image, or (color:,size:)
 - SKPhysicsBody on the frame, and for rectangles or circles. Properties: isDynamic, resitution
 - Detecting touches in touchesBegan() and placing objects on the touch's location

** Day 46

*** SKAction to rotate a node:
#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
        let spin = SKAction.rotate(byAngle: .pi, duration: 10)
        let spinForever = SKAction.repeatForever(spin)
        slotGlow.run(spinForever)
#+END_SRC
*** Collision detection using: SKPhysicsContactDelegate
First set the delegate to self:
#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
physicsWorld.contactDelegate = self
#+END_SRC
And then implement didBegin(_ contact), which contains bodyA and bodyB.
*** SKLabelNode and detecting if the Label was touched
In touchesBegan() get the location of the initial touch. Then search for nodes(at: thisLocation):
#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
        guard let touch = touches.first else { return }
        let location = touch.location(in: self)
        
        // check if they tapped the edit label or it's outside
        let objects = nodes(at: location)
        if objects.contains(editLabel) {
            editingMode.toggle()
#+END_SRC

** Day 47 - Challenge

1. The pictures we’re using in have other ball pictures rather than just “ballRed”. Try writing code to use a random ball color each time they tap the screen.
2. Right now, users can tap anywhere to have a ball created there, which makes the game too easy. Try to force the Y value of new balls so they are near the top of the screen.
3. Give players a limit of five balls, then remove obstacle boxes when they are hit. Can they clear all the pins with just five balls? You could make it so that landing on a green slot gets them an extra ball.
